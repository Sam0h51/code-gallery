<h1>Introduction</h1>

This program aims at solving non-uniform isotropic heat equation
@f{align*}
\rho C_m \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot (\nabla k T) &= f(\mathbf x,t), \qquad\qquad &&
  \forall \mathbf x \in \Omega, t\in (0,t_i),\\
  T(\mathbf x, 0) &= u_0(\mathbf x) &&
  \forall \mathbf x \in \Omega, \\
  \\
  T(\mathbf x, t) &= g(\mathbf x,t) &&
  \forall \mathbf x \in \partial\Omega, t \in (0,t_i).

which is identical to the preceding program step-26, but taking advantages of distributed memory parallel computing (step-31, step-32 and and step-40). The matrix form of the equation is then
@f{align*}
(M + dt \theta A) U_T^n = [M - dt (1-\theta) A] U_T^{n-1} + dt (1-\theta) F^{n-1} + dt \theta F^{n}
@f}

where matrices $M$, $A$ and $U_T$ are 
@f{align*}
M_{i,j} &= \int \rho C_m T^{'}_i T^{'}_j dV\\
A_{i,j} &= \int k \nabla T^{'}_i \nabla T^{'}_j dV \\
F^n_i &= \int T^{'}_i f^n(\mathbf x) dV
@f}

where $n$ is the time step number, and $dt$ is the time step.

<h3> The initial condition </h3>
deall.II provides an interpolation function (VectorTools::interpolate) to distribute initial conditions. However, in this tutorial,
we are going to initialize in another way. The mechanism is based on the general form of solution as series of test functions
@f{align*}
T &= \sum_i u_i T^'_i = g_0(\mathbf x)\\
\int u_i T^'_i T^'_j &= \int g_0(\mathbf x) T^'_i dV\\
M_0 U_0 &= \int g_0(\mathbf x) T^'_i dV\\
@f}

<h3> The testcase </h3>
In this test program, a laser spot is focused onto the top layer (a TiO$_2$ thin film). 
Typical heat characteristics are $C_m = 690 J/kg/K$, thermal conductivity $k = 4.8 W/m/K$, and mass
density is $4200 kg/m^3$.The laser spot is moving at speed $V$. In fact, experiments are always carried 
out by translating samples instead as laser system is hard to be moved. The substrate is glass. Typical 
heat characteristics are $C_m = 700 J/kg/K$, thermal conductivity $k = 1.8 W/m/K$, and mass density is 
$2200 kg/m^3$. The laser spot size in diameter is $c_0 = 20 \mu m$ at $e^{-2}$ with power $ P_0 = 0.4 W$. The moving speed of the laser beam is
$V = 10 mm/s$. The initial laser spot center locates at $x_0 = -50 \mu m$ with $50 \mu m$ away from the left boundary.
The time step is 10 $\mu s$. 

The glass substrate does not absorb the laser energy. In this test program, the TiO$_2$ thin film is assumed to be 
mixed with silver nanoparticles, which support absorbing photon energy. For simplicity, the absorption coefficient is 
taken as $\alpha = 10^4 m^{-1}$. The laser intensity is assumed to obey Beer-Lambert law
@f{align*}
I(y) &= I_0(x) \exp{-\apha y}\\
I_0(x)  &= \frac{P_0}{2 \Pi a^2} \exp{-(x - V t - x_0)^2 / (2 a^2)}
@f}
where $a = c_0 / 4$ is a gaussian parameter.
