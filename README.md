# code-gallery
The [code gallery](https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/CodeGallery.html)
is a collection of codes based on [deal.II](https://www.dealii.org)
contributed by deal.II users. These codes typically solve problems more
complicated than those in the deal.II tutorial. Their intention is to solve
actual problems, rather than demonstrate particular aspects of deal.II. The
code gallery is, however, cross linked from the
[set of tutorials](https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html#TutorialConnectionGraph).

### Building the documentation

To build the doxygen documentation, simply check out the code gallery git
repository into the main deal.II source directory (parallel to the
`examples`, or `doc` directory), and then build the deal.II documentation
as
[described in the readme](https://www.dealii.org/developer/readme.html#documentation).
It will pick up the code gallery and create joint documentation for the
tutorial and the code gallery.

### Maintenance of contributed codes

The examples in the code-gallery are periodically adjusted so that they
maintain compatibility with recent versions of deal.II. This means
that their implementation may be modified slightly in the process, perhaps breaking
compatibility with older versions of deal.II. Older version of each
contributed code may be attained by checking out the appropriate git commit
of the code-gallery repository.
