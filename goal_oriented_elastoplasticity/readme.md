### 3d goal-oriented mesh adaptivity in elastoplasticity problems

The code deals with solving an elastoplasticity problem with linear isotropic hardening. At each load/displacement step, the error based on a prescribed quantity of interest (Goal-oriented error estimation) is computed by using the dual-weighted residual method.

Based on a prescribed error bound and estimated elementwise errors,
the mesh is then refined/coarsened. Afterwards, the solution is projected to the new mesh and the analysis process is repeated.

The applied methodology and the solved numerical examples can be found in the following paper:

### Running the code

The code contains several examples consisting of the three examples presented in the aforementioned paper. To run each of them you can switch to them, e.g.
```
git checkout Thick_tube_internal_pressure

git checkout  Perforated_strip_displacement_3d

git checkout  Cantiliver_II_beam_3d
```

Then by compiling it using the following commands
```
cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/deal.II .
make
```
you can run it by typing
```
./elastoplastic Thick_tube_internal_pressure.prm
```
or
```
./elastoplastic Perforated_strip_displacement_3d.prm
```
or
```
./elastoplastic Cantiliver_II_beam_3d.prm
```
 
The three named input files are already in the current directory, and
have the following options:
```
